<h1>Crypt Password Manager Description</h1>

This is a full stack Password Manager website that I built as a personal project to test what I have learned through coursework, my internship, and what I could teach myself. 
The funciton of Crypt is to allow a user to create an account that would be able to store login information for different services that require Username/Email and Passwords.
The use of my project is that when a new service is added to the account a randomly generated Strong/Very Strong strength password is generated for the user to use as that services password.
I utilized HTML and CSS as frontend design, JavaScript for backend functionality implementation, and PHP and SQL to setup and utilize a functional database.

<h2>Current Password Generation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>- Creates a password of length 8-12 characters.</li>
  <li>- Utilizes a random choice of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
  <li>- Randomly assigns an order with no specified pattern.</li>
</ul>
